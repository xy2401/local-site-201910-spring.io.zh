<li>What's New in Spring</li>
<li>In the opening Keynote of the Spring eXchange 2014, Dave Syer recounts the recent developments in the Spring ecosystem, going back about 12 months or so. Spring is fun again and all the cool kids all want to play with it since Spring Boot hit the streets in 2013. Looking at this in the context of Spring IO and Spring Cloud, Dave will also cover recent updates to Foundation projects like Spring 4.1 and 4.2, Spring Batch 3.0, Spring Integration 4.1 and Spring Data Evans, plus Execution layer projects like Spring XD for Big Data and Grails for full-stack web applications. You will be surprised and pleased to see how easy it is to build applications and services and to glue them together into distributed systems, especially if you haven't used Spring, or haven't seen it recently.</li>

<li>Big Data, Little Time : Taking the Complexity out of creating Big Data applications </li>
<li>Creating Big Data applications is a relatively new art and developing a comprehensive solution can be challenging. Some of the key challenges arise from bringing together complex domains such as stream analysis, batch workflow orchestration and data import and export. Furthermore, building such applications normally requires stitching together disparate products. Spring XD is a new project that aims to tackle big data complexity. It builds upon proven Spring technologies to tie together these domains and provide a scalable, distributed, and fault-tolerant runtime environment. You do not need to be a Java developer to get started. A simple DSL lets you build complex stream and job definitions that includes the scoring of machine learning algorithms in just a few simple steps.</li>

<li>Getting started with Spring </li>
<li> Spring is much more than a single framework - it is a rich ecosystem with multiple projects, all helping to build modern applications. But all this can be a bit intimidating for Spring beginners. Stéphane Nicoll and Brian Clozel will walk you through the core concepts and thought model behind the Spring Framework; they’ll cover the main aspects of the Framework, but also introduce you to key features in other Spring projects, including the latest Spring IO platform. After this session, you’ll leave with a common approach for all Spring portfolio projects and all the keys to successfully start with Spring in 2014.</li>

<li>Asynchronous Design with Spring and RTI: 1M Events per Second </li>
<li>An application designer usually has to choose where to trade flexibility for specificity (and thus usually performance); knowing when and where to do so is an art and requires experience. This talk will share over a decades worth of experience making these decisions and the learnings from developing Pivotal's successful Real Time Intelligence (RTI) product using the latest versions of Spring projects: Integration, Data, Boot, MVC/REST and XD. A walk through the RTI architecture will provide the base for an explanation about how Spring performs at hundreds (and millions) of events/operations per second and the techniques that you can use right now in your own Spring applications to minimise resource utilisation and gain performance.</li>

<li>Building "Bootiful" Applications with Spring Boot </li>
<li>Alright, so maybe "bootiful" won't ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you're reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.</li>

<li>A guided tour to Spring XD internals </li>
<li>What happens when a Stream is deployed to a Spring XD cluster? How does Stream processing and data partitioning work? How does the cluster recover when a Spring XD container goes down? We'll cover all those topics and some more using live demos in this deep dive session about Spring XD</li>

<li>Reactive Micro-Services with Reactor </li>
<li>Micro Service Architecture is now becoming the standard for a large range of companies. Amid the problems to solve when building micro-services, developers might need to think asynchronous. Reactor offers a progressive and non opinionated concurrency handling to any JVM application — and beyond. Not only is it a handy lightweight toolkit, it is also part of the Reactive-Streams specification and as such is interoperable with friends such as RxJava or Akka. Come discover some tips and tricks when building micro-services on top of Reactor, understand how it builds on top of Reactive-Streams specification and why this is a game changer in today's software development.</li>

<li>Designing REST-ful Micro-services with Spring Boot </li>
<li>As data-driven applications become ubiquitous, the services that provide the data are proliferating. As teams become responsible for more and more of these services, it becomes critical that they be designed and implemented in a way that is as lightweight as possible. This session will cover how to design micro-services as RESTful APIs and implement them with minimal code using Spring Boot. It will focus on API design using REST and HATEOAS, with live coding progressing all the way to a full-fledged app running in the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<li>Building "Bootiful" Applications with Spring Cloud </li>
<li>Alright, so maybe "bootiful" won't ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you're reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long @starbuxman for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, web, batch, big-data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started. Let's take advantage of the dynamic nature of a virtual JUG: I will be live coding and (attempting to) answer your questions on all things Spring and Spring Boot as I introduce the technology. </li>

<li>Spring Data REST - Repositories meet Hypermedia </li>
<li>The Spring Data repository abstraction significantly eases implementing data access layers in Java. On top of that the REST module of the umbrella project provides a programming model to easily expose hypermedia-driven REST resources to interact with the repositories. The talk discusses the patterns Spring Data REST implements, how internet standards and specifications influence the design and how the modules exposes meta-data to build loosely coupled clients. The presentation contains a lot of hands on code samples to demonstrate the discussed aspects.</li>

<li>Inside Spring.io: A production Spring Reference Application </li>
<li>Would you like to take a look inside the newly open-sourced reference application that powers the spring.io site? Then join Spring Guru Brian Clozel who will survey some of the features behind the harmonized platform. This talk will cover the following:
<ul>
<li>Idiomatic use of Spring Boot </li>
<li>Taking advantage of Spring Framework 4 features </li>
<li>A tour of our JavaScript frontend using cujoJS's curl, Bower and Gulp for a clean and modular design </li>
<li>Zero-downtime deployment to Cloud Foundry using blue/green deployments </li>

<li>What's new in Spring Data? </li>
<li>This talk will give a broad overview of the new features introduced in the latest Spring Data release trains. We will cover recent additions and improvements in Spring Data Commons - the module that's shared amongst the store specific ones. We'll then delve into the latest and greatest features of individual store modules, like JPA, MongoDB, Neo4j, Solr and the community ones as well.</li>
</ul>

<li>Documenting RESTful APIs </li>
<li>An API's documentation is a vital part of making it easy to understand and easy to use. RESTful APIs are no different. In this talk we'll look at what should be included in your RESTful APIs documentation and, just as importantly, what should not be included. We'll look at a number of real-world examples of good and bad API documentation before considering a number of different approaches for producing documentation for a RESTful API built using Spring.</li>

<li>Boot your search with Spring </li>
<li>Searching data has become mission critical in days of google. We want to find, not to search! This session focuses on solutions for integrating search into your application. We’ll have a look on Spring Data’s search abstraction for Apache Solr, Elasticsearch and Mongodb and do some hands on auto configuration using Spring Boot (100% XML free setup guaranteed). You choose the technology, Spring gives you tools to get going.</li>

<li>The State of Securing RESTful APIs with Spring </li>
<li>Learn how to properly secure your RESTful endpoint, explore some common pitfalls when applying security to RESTful API and discover how the new features in Spring Security can greatly simplify securing your RESTful APIs. The many benefits of a RESTful architecture has made it the standard way in which to design web based APIs. For example, the principles of REST state that we should leverage standard HTTP verbs which helps to keep our APIs simple. Server components that are considered RESTFul should be stateless which help to ensure that they can easily scale. We can leverage caching to gain further performance and scalability benefits. However, the best practices of REST and security often seem to clash. How should a user be authenticated in a stateless application? How can a secured resource also support caching? Securing RESTful endpoints is further complicated by the the fact that security best practices evolve so rapidly. In this talk Rob will discuss how to properly secure your RESTful endpoints. Along the way we will explore some common pitfalls when applying security to RESTful APIs. Finally, we will see how the new features in Spring Security can greatly simplify securing your RESTful APIs.</li>
</ul>

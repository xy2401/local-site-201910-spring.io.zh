<meta name="twitter:description" content="<p>Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! I hope our American readers had a pleasant 4th of July, and I hope everybody else had a pleasant Friday! </p>
<p>There is, as usual, a lot to discuss this week so let's get to it! </p>
<ol> 
 <li>Sleepless Spring Security lead Rob Winch has just announced the <a href=" http: spring.io blog 2014 07 08 spring-session-1-0-0-m1-released"></head><body>first milestone of Spring Session. Spring Session makes it easy to access a session from any environment (i.e. web, messaging infrastructure, etc), support for clustering in a vendor neutral way, plug in strategies for determining the session ID, and easily keep the HttpSession alive when a WebSocket is active. This is <em>really</em> cool! And, in fact, it might solve an issue I faced just last week where I wanted to access the HTTP session from a Web Socket handler! 
 <li><a href="http://twitter.com/ankinson">Andy Wilkinson</a> has just announced <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/07/08/spring-boot-1-1-4-released">Spring Boot 1.1.4 release</a>. The new release includes many bug-fixes and small new features, including support for the first stable preview release of Tomcat 8. </li> 
 <li>Andy <em>also</em> just announced the first <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/07/08/spring-io-platform-1-0-1-released">maintenance release to Spring IO</a> which updates versions across the platform to include Spring AMQP 1.3.5, Spring Boot 1.1.4, Spring Batch 3.0.1, Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.0.1, and Spring Framework 4.0.6. Nice job, Andy!</li> 
 <li>Thomas Risberg has just <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/07/08/spring-for-apache-hadoop-2-0-1-released">announced Spring for Apache Hadoop 2.0.1</a> which revs the dependency versions, including Hadoop 2.4.1, Spring framework 4.0.6.RELEASE, Spring Batch to 3.0.1.RELEASE, Spring Boot to 1.1.4.RELEASE. </li> 
 <li>Stéphane Nicoll has just announced that <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/07/08/spring-framework-4-0-6-released">Spring framework 4.0.6 is now available</a>. This release includes about 50 bugfixes.</li> 
 <li>Spring Social lead Craig Walls has just announced that <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/07/03/spring-social-facebook-2-0-0-m1-released">Spring Social Facebook 2.0.0.M1 is now available</a>. This release supports the new Facebook v2.0.0 Graph API, which introduces some breaking, obligatory, changes (thanks, Facebook!).</li> 
 <li>Groovy project lead <a href="http://twitter.com/glaforge">Guillaume LaForge</a> has announced <a href="http://beta.groovy-lang.org">the beta of the new Groovy website</a> and is soliciting feedback from the community at large.</li> 
 <li>From the trenches: Join Casey Doolittle and Phil Dutson on July 15th for a webinar about a crazy project, and how they had to <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/06/10/webinar-building-a-shopping-cart-in-24-hours-using-spring">Build a Shopping Cart in 24 Hours using Spring</a>.</li> 
 <li><a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/06/12/webinar-why-do-i-recommend-spring">Check out this upcoming webinar by Michael Plod on why he recommends Spring</a> - learn the technology (and a bit of the business) case! Michael is a great speaker and frequently appears at conferences. Register now for the event on July 22nd.</li> 
 <li><a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/06/12/webinar-conquering-content-enabled-web-and-mobile-applications-with-spring-and-groovy"></a>On July 29th, Russ Danner from Crafter software will tell us about <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/06/12/webinar-conquering-content-enabled-web-and-mobile-applications-with-spring-and-groovy">Conquering Content-enabled Web and Mobile Applications with Spring and Groovy</a>.</li> 
 <li>Last year, Spring tool ninjas Andy Clement and Martin Lippert did a great talk at <a href="http://spring.io/blog/2014/07/03/springone2gx-2013-replay-tooling-for-spring-s-next-generation">SpringOne2GX 2013 introducing the latest and greatest tooling</a>.</li> 
 <li>Last year at SpringOne2GX 2013, Julien Dubois (you might recognise him from <a href="http://jhipster.github.io/">JHipster</a>..) did a great talk <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/03/springone2gx-2013-replay-performance-tuning-the-spring-petclinic-sample-application">looking at how to run and performance tune the classic Spring petclinic application</a>.</li> 
 <li>Dr. Dobb's had a nice <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cloud/summer-brings-spring-io/240168606">post looking at the new Spring IO release</a>. </li> 
 <li>InfoQ's <a href="http://twitter.com/mraible">Matt Raible</a> also put together a nice look at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/07/springio-platform">Spring IO</a>. Check it out!</li> 
 <li>The <a href="http://literatejava.com/spring/explicit-vs-implicit-configuration-spring/">Literate Java blog</a> has an interesting post on <em>implicit</em> (component-scan-centric) vs. <em>explicit</em> configuration (using XML) in Spring. I'd argue that Java configuration should really be considered as it offers the best of both explicit XML configuration (centralized, easy-to-reason about configuration) and implicit, but type-safe, Java annotation-and-component-scann-centric configuration. Either way, interesting post! </li> 
 <li>Spring Boot <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/languages-and-frameworks">is now in Thoughtwork's technology radar under <em>assess.</em></a></li> 
 <li>The Codeleak.pl site has a nice look at one of the <a href="http://blog.codeleak.pl/2014/07/spring-4-cglib-based-proxy-classes-with-no-default-ctor.html">smaller, but super powerful, features in Spring 4 - CGLIB proxies no longer require a default constructor!</a> </li> 
 <li>I've enjoyed this series of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iyNX2ycdyY">tutorials on using Spring and Angular.js</a>. You might as well. Nice job, Christopher Henkel!</li> 
 <li>The Apprenticeship Notes blog has a nice <em>series</em> of tutorials on how to use <a href="http://www.apprenticeshipnotes.org/2014/06/spring-mvc-thymeleaf-bootstrap-twitter.html">Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap together</a>. </li> 
 <li>The <em>Autoletics</em> blog has a <a href="http://www.autoletics.com/posts/an-allocation-reaction-within-reactor">nice, numbers-filled, look at their experience profiling the Reactor project</a>. Interesting stuff! Some of the points are interesting, too. As readers of this roundup know, <a href="http://github.com/reactor">Reactor</a> is a highly concurrent event-driven IO-ready platform. And, it's <em>ridiculously</em> fast. </li> 
 <li>I wanted to give a hat tip to <a href="http://psnively.github.io/">Paul Snively</a>, who has been using the 1-2 punch combo of the Spring (and Scala) and a third-party <a href="https://github.com/dgradecak/alfresco-mvc">integration of Spring MVC for Alfresco to build Alfresco-powered solutions</a>. Nice!</li> 
 <li> Whether you like the new Groovy website or not (although, why wouldn't you?), you'll <a href="http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/groovy-2-3-4-is-out">love the new Groovy 2.3.4 release</a> which just dropped today and includes improvements on static compilation and AST transformations. </li> 
 <li> <a href="http://hornetq.jboss.org">HornetQ</a> project-lead Clebert Suconic is inviting community feedback about <a href="http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Possible-HornetQ-donation-to-ActiveMQ-td4682971.html">a proposed contribution of HornetQ to the Apache ActiveMQ project</a>. We know that developers in our community know and use both, so perhaps now's a prudent time to feedback if this proposed merger affects you! I personally like the idea. ActiveMQ.next (long codenamed "Apollo") seems like it could use the hug that a HornetQ-contribution could give it. And, of course, Spring Boot supports both ActiveMQ and HornetQ now, so either way, you're set! </li>

<li>Last year, Spring tool ninjas Andy Clement and Martin Lippert did a great talk at <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/03/springone2gx-2013-replay-tooling-for-spring-s-next-generation">SpringOne2GX 2013 introducing the latest and greatest tooling</a>.</li>
<li>Last year at SpringOne2GX 2013, Julien Dubois (you might recognise him from <a href="https://jhipster.github.io/">JHipster</a>..) did a great talk <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2014/07/03/springone2gx-2013-replay-performance-tuning-the-spring-petclinic-sample-application">looking at how to run and performance tune the classic Spring petclinic application</a>.</li>
<li>Dr. Dobb's had a nice <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cloud/summer-brings-spring-io/240168606">post looking at the new Spring IO release</a>. </li>
<li>InfoQ's <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible">Matt Raible</a> also put together a nice look at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/07/springio-platform">Spring IO</a>. Check it out!</li>
<li>The <a href="http://literatejava.com/spring/explicit-vs-implicit-configuration-spring/">Literate Java blog</a> has an interesting post on <em>implicit</em> (component-scan-centric) vs. <em>explicit</em> configuration (using XML) in Spring. I'd argue that Java configuration should really be considered as it offers the best of both explicit XML configuration (centralized, easy-to-reason about configuration) and implicit, but type-safe, Java annotation-and-component-scann-centric configuration. Either way, interesting post! </li>
<li>Spring Boot <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/languages-and-frameworks">is now in Thoughtwork's technology radar under <em>assess.</em></a></li>
<li>The Codeleak.pl site has a nice look at one of the <a href="http://blog.codeleak.pl/2014/07/spring-4-cglib-based-proxy-classes-with-no-default-ctor.html">smaller, but super powerful, features in Spring 4 - CGLIB proxies no longer require a default constructor!</a> </li>
<li>I've enjoyed this series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iyNX2ycdyY">tutorials on using Spring and Angular.js</a>. You might as well. Nice job, Christopher Henkel!</li>
<li>The Apprenticeship Notes blog has a nice <em>series</em> of tutorials on how to use <a href="http://www.apprenticeshipnotes.org/2014/06/spring-mvc-thymeleaf-bootstrap-twitter.html">Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, and Bootstrap together</a>. </li>
<li>The <em>Autoletics</em> blog has a <a href="http://www.autoletics.com/posts/an-allocation-reaction-within-reactor">nice, numbers-filled, look at their experience profiling the Reactor project</a>. Interesting stuff! Some of the points are interesting, too. As readers of this roundup know, <a href="https://github.com/reactor">Reactor</a> is a highly concurrent event-driven IO-ready platform. And, it's <em>ridiculously</em> fast. </li>
<li>I wanted to give a hat tip to <a href="https://psnively.github.io/">Paul Snively</a>, who has been using the 1-2 punch combo of the Spring (and Scala) and a third-party <a href="https://github.com/dgradecak/alfresco-mvc">integration of Spring MVC for Alfresco to build Alfresco-powered solutions</a>. Nice!</li>
<li> Whether you like the new Groovy website or not (although, why wouldn't you?), you'll <a href="https://glaforge.appspot.com/article/groovy-2-3-4-is-out">love the new Groovy 2.3.4 release</a> which just dropped today and includes improvements on static compilation and AST transformations. </li>
<li> <a href="http://hornetq.jboss.org">HornetQ</a> project-lead Clebert Suconic is inviting community feedback about <a href="http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Possible-HornetQ-donation-to-ActiveMQ-td4682971.html">a proposed contribution of HornetQ to the Apache ActiveMQ project</a>. We know that developers in our community know and use both, so perhaps now's a prudent time to feedback if this proposed merger affects you! I personally like the idea. ActiveMQ.next (long codenamed "Apollo") seems like it could use the hug that a HornetQ-contribution could give it. And, of course, Spring Boot supports both ActiveMQ and HornetQ now, so either way, you're set! </li>

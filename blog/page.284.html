<div><p>亲爱的春季社区，</p>
<p>我们很高兴地宣布一个新的里程碑版本（1.1.0。支持Neo4j的Spring Data Graph项目的M2）现已可用！</p>
<p><b>Spring Data</b>项目的主要目标是使使用新数据访问技术（例如非关系数据库，map-reduce框架和基于云的数据服务）的使用Spring支持的应用程序更容易构建。</p>
<p>Graph Neo4j模块提供与<a href="http://neo4j.org">Neo4j</a>图形数据库的集成。早在2010年，Rod Johnson和Emil Eifrem就关于Spring和Neo4j的集成（包括透明的持久性和跨商店支持）进行了集思广益。在最初的原型之后，它已经在VMware和Neo Technology开发团队之间紧密合作下进一步开发。</p>

<ol>
<pre><code class="prettyprint"><LI> The video from  Grails Advocate Peter Ledbrook's webinar,  "Tuning Your Grails Applications," has been <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3182">made available here.</a> Lots of great tidbits for web developers in general, as well as Grails developers in specific. Be sure to check out the other great content on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/SpringSourceDev">SpringSource YouTube channel.</a> 
    </li> 
       <LI>  
 <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/">OSCON  is right around the corner</a>, and SpringSource is going to be there in full force!  
         Come see yours truly (Josh Long), Steve Mayzak, Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Derek Collison, Bruce Snyder, David McCrory, James Watters and others talk about Spring, CloudFoundry, and much more at OSCON (as well as OSCON Java, and OSCON Data!).  Also, feel free to check out our booth where we'd be happy to  answer questions, introduce you to   new technologies and meet and greet. 
         Going to be there? Let us know, send us a message on Twitter to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/SpringSource">@SpringSource</a>.
           </li>
    <LI><a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3180">Spring Data Redis 1.0.0.M4 has been released</a>
         The new release features several improvements. My favorite? A Spring 3.1 <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that uses Redis! Out of the box, <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/23/spring-3-1-m1-caching/">Spring 3.1's cache abstraction</a> supports a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation based on the <CODE>java.util.Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface, and an Ehcache implementation. The <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-gemfire">Spring Gemfire</a> project ships with a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that delegates to GemFire, as well. This new Redis implementation adds to the raft of options available already, and Spring 3.1's not even GA!
        </li>
       <LI>
       Speaking of Redis, check out this upcoming webinar, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3179">Getting Started with Spring Data Redis.</a> 
        From the description, "This webinar will introduce Redis, its data structures, the fundamental concepts behind it and the Redis support in Spring Data, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry." Be sure to tune in!      
         </li>

         <LI>    <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3183">Spring Integration 2.0.5 has just been released.</a>
          This release addresses 48 issues of which roughly half were bugs and half were improvements. For details <A href="https://jira.springsource.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10121&version=12104">see the Release Notes</a>.  </li> 
<LI>Dr. David Syer, lead of the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/">Spring Batch project,</a> lead of the Spring Hadoop project, committer on just about everything else, and nice guy, all around, has just posted an amazingly clear, helpful post on navigating <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/07/18/social-coding-pull-requests-what-to-do-when-things-get-complicated/">the rough waters of a complicated Git pull request</a>. A <em>must-read</em> if - like me - you know  that Git could solve all your workflow problems, if you only  really understood it!   
     Remember, the process starts on <a href="http://git.SpringSource.org/">git.SpringSource.org</a> and on <a href="http://www.github.com/SpringSource">github.com/SpringSource</a>. 
    Check it ... err... <em>clone</em> it out!

         <LI>    <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3183">Spring Integration 2.0.5 has just been released.</a>
          This release addresses 48 issues of which roughly half were bugs and half were improvements. For details <A href="https://jira.springsource.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10121&version=12104">see the Release Notes</a>.  </li> 
<LI>Dr. David Syer, lead of the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/">Spring Batch project,</a> lead of the Spring Hadoop project, committer on just about everything else, and nice guy, all around, has just posted an amazingly clear, helpful post on navigating <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/07/18/social-coding-pull-requests-what-to-do-when-things-get-complicated/">the rough waters of a complicated Git pull request</a>. A <em>must-read</em> if - like me - you know  that Git could solve all your workflow problems, if you only  really understood it!   
     Remember, the process starts on <a href="http://git.SpringSource.org/">git.SpringSource.org</a> and on <a href="http://www.github.com/SpringSource">github.com/SpringSource</a>. 
    Check it ... err... <em>clone</em> it out!

    <LI><a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3180">Spring Data Redis 1.0.0.M4 has been released</a>
         The new release features several improvements. My favorite? A Spring 3.1 <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that uses Redis! Out of the box, <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/23/spring-3-1-m1-caching/">Spring 3.1's cache abstraction</a> supports a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation based on the <CODE>java.util.Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface, and an Ehcache implementation. The <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-gemfire">Spring Gemfire</a> project ships with a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that delegates to GemFire, as well. This new Redis implementation adds to the raft of options available already, and Spring 3.1's not even GA!

       Speaking of Redis, check out this upcoming webinar, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3179">Getting Started with Spring Data Redis.</a> 
        From the description, "This webinar will introduce Redis, its data structures, the fundamental concepts behind it and the Redis support in Spring Data, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry." Be sure to tune in!

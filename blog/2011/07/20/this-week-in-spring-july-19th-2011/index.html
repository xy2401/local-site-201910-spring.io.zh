         Come see yours truly (Josh Long), Steve Mayzak, Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Derek Collison, Bruce Snyder, David McCrory, James Watters and others talk about Spring, CloudFoundry, and much more at OSCON (as well as OSCON Java, and OSCON Data!).  Also, feel free to check out our booth where we'd be happy to  answer questions, introduce you to   new technologies and meet and greet.

    <LI><a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3180">Spring Data Redis 1.0.0.M4 has been released</a>
         The new release features several improvements. My favorite? A Spring 3.1 <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that uses Redis! Out of the box, <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/23/spring-3-1-m1-caching/">Spring 3.1's cache abstraction</a> supports a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation based on the <CODE>java.util.Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> interface, and an Ehcache implementation. The <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-gemfire">Spring Gemfire</a> project ships with a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that delegates to GemFire, as well. This new Redis implementation adds to the raft of options available already, and Spring 3.1's not even GA!
        </li>
       <LI>
       Speaking of Redis, check out this upcoming webinar, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3179">Getting Started with Spring Data Redis.</a> 
        From the description, "This webinar will introduce Redis, its data structures, the fundamental concepts behind it and the Redis support in Spring Data, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry." Be sure to tune in!

         <LI>    <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3183">Spring Integration 2.0.5 has just been released.</a>
          This release addresses 48 issues of which roughly half were bugs and half were improvements. For details <A href="https://jira.springsource.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10121&version=12104">see the Release Notes</a>.  </li> 
<LI>Dr. David Syer, lead of the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/">Spring Batch project,</a> lead of the Spring Hadoop project, committer on just about everything else, and nice guy, all around, has just posted an amazingly clear, helpful post on navigating <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/07/18/social-coding-pull-requests-what-to-do-when-things-get-complicated/">the rough waters of a complicated Git pull request</a>. A <em>must-read</em> if - like me - you know  that Git could solve all your workflow problems, if you only  really understood it!   
     Remember, the process starts on <a href="http://git.SpringSource.org/">git.SpringSource.org</a> and on <a href="http://www.github.com/SpringSource">github.com/SpringSource</a>. 
    Check it ... err... <em>clone</em> it out!

The <A href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-gemfire">Spring Gemfire</a> project ships with a <CODE>CacheManager</CODE> implementation that delegates to GemFire, as well. This new Redis implementation adds to the raft of options available already, and Spring 3.1's not even GA!

       Speaking of Redis, check out this upcoming webinar, <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3179">Getting Started with Spring Data Redis.</a> 
        From the description, "This webinar will introduce Redis, its data structures, the fundamental concepts behind it and the Redis support in Spring Data, and will showcase how easy it is to get started and scale out into a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry." Be sure to tune in!

         <LI>    <a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/3183">Spring Integration 2.0.5 has just been released.</a>
          This release addresses 48 issues of which roughly half were bugs and half were improvements. For details <A href="https://jira.springsource.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10121&version=12104">see the Release Notes</a>.  </li> 
<LI>Dr. David Syer, lead of the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/">Spring Batch project,</a> lead of the Spring Hadoop project, committer on just about everything else, and nice guy, all around, has just posted an amazingly clear, helpful post on navigating <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/07/18/social-coding-pull-requests-what-to-do-when-things-get-complicated/">the rough waters of a complicated Git pull request</a>. A <em>must-read</em> if - like me - you know  that Git could solve all your workflow problems, if you only  really understood it!   
     Remember, the process starts on <a href="http://git.SpringSource.org/">git.SpringSource.org</a> and on <a href="http://www.github.com/SpringSource">github.com/SpringSource</a>. 
    Check it ... err... <em>clone</em> it out!

This stuff, following the new Spring MVC 3.2 servlet 3 support, is sure to make Servlet 3 environments like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">Apache Tomcat 7</a> an attractive offering for anyone doing serious enterprise work: no pain upgrades, lightweight <em>and</em> you get all these cool new runtime capabilities with Spring 3.2 and Spring Security.<br> </li>

  Guys, <A href= "http://www.w3.org/News/2012#entry-9667">HTML 5 was just <em>completed</EM></a>. 

  From the release: "Though not yet W3C standards, these specifications are now feature complete, meaning businesses and developers have a stable target for implementation and planning."

  What's this mean for you guys in practice? Not much - HTML5 as we know it has been fairly stable for some time, but if you were looking for a reason to take the plunge, that should be it.  And, SpringSource is ushering in the new era of 
  HTML5 and JavaScript development with <EM>lots</EM> of interesting stuff 
  aimed at civilizing this new frontier and increasing productivity. 
  For a peak at some of the new bits, check out the upcoming webinars 
  <a href= "http://www.springsource.org/node/3768"><EM>IOC + JavaScript</EM></a> and

<pre><code class="prettyprint"> Welcome back to another installment of <EM>This Week in Spring</EM>! 
There's a lot to cover, so let's dive into it! 
</p>
<OL>
    <LI>  Always eager to help ring in the new year properly, Mark Fisher announced the <a href  = "http://blog.springsource.org/2012/01/09/spring-integration-2-1-is-now-ga/">Spring Integration 2.1 GA</a> yesterday.   
        The new release has <EM>everything</EM>, and then some! It features new or revised support for a broad spectrum of technologies including AMQP, JDBC, GemFire, MongoDB, Redis, and much, much more. 
       </LI>

       <LI>Andy Clement and Martin Lippert's <a href = "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Spring-Tooling-Update-New-Noteworthy">update on the latest and greatest on the SpringSource Tool  Suite tooling</a> from SpringOne2GX is up and available.  Check it out! 

         </LI>
     <LI> Speaking of <a href  = "http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring  Integration</a>, fans of the art of integration should check out John Davies' excellent talk on  <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Enterprise-Integration">how his company is employing Spring Integration  to build massively scalable applications</a>.
        Take it from me - a hardened enterprise integration wonk - John Davies has been around in this industry for a <EM>looong</EM> time, and he knows what he's talking about.  
       </LI>


    <LI> The fine folks at <a href ="http://labs.bsb.com/">BSB labs</a>   have been playing with <a href = "http://labs.bsb.com/2011/12/spring-profiles-management-for-application-customization/">Spring 3.1 profile  activation</a>. The  blog entry comes complete with sample    code on GitHub!  </LI>

<div><p>Spring Integration 2.1已发布！您可以<a href="http://www.springsource.com/download/community?project=Spring Integration" target="_blank">在此处</a>下载它或<a href="http://www.springsource.org/node/2962" target="_blank">配置Maven POM</a> 。这个版本是一年多的工作成果，自从Spring Integration 2.0发布以来，该团队已经解决了数百个问题。有趣的是，距Spring Integration首次公开发布（2008年1月3日发布0.5版）已有4年零几天了。在本文中，我只是想快速概述2.1的主要新功能。</p>
<h3>RabbitMQ / AMQP支持</h3>
<p>在“ spring-integration-amqp”模块中，我们具有用于单向消息传递的通道适配器以及用于请求/回复的网关。适配器和网关可用于与RabbitMQ代理进行入站和/或出站集成。我们还有AMQP支持的消息通道实现-点对点和发布/订阅-都可以在流程中间的任何地方使用。有关更多信息，请参见参考手册的<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/docs/2.1.x/reference/htmlsingle/#amqp" target="_blank">这一部分</a> 。</p>

<p>新年快乐！<br>希望您的新年和假期都很棒。<br>并且，欢迎回到<em>春季本周的</em>另一期。</p>
<pre><code class="prettyprint">This year is going to be <EM>incredible</EM>, so let's dive right into it.  



This week's  roundup features some content from the last few weeks. Particularly, we've got content that InfoQ   put up     
from the <a href = "http://www.springone2gx.com">SpringOne2GX 2011</a> conference.  
</code></pre>
<p>感谢<a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a>与往常一样分享这一精彩内容。</p>
<ol>
<pre><code class="prettyprint"><LI> 
Garry Russel and David Turanski's SpringOne2GX presentation on implementing <a href= "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Implementing-HA-Architectures-Spring-Integration">highly available architectures using Spring Integration</a> is now up on InfoQ. 
     </LI>

<LI> Rob Winch demoes some of the <A href = "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Spring-Security-3-1">new features in Spring Security 3.1</a>: multiple http elements, stateless authentication mode for RESTful services, Debug Filter, CAS support for proxy tickets, JAAS, etc.  This is another great presentation from SpringOne2GX 2011. 
   </LI>

<LI> 
    Rossen Stoyanchev's presentation at SpringOne2GX 2011 on the <a href = "http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Spring-MVC-3-1-Update">new features in Spring MVC 3.1 is now up over at InfoQ</a>.
     </LI>

    <LI> Community member and DevNexus organizer Gunnar Hillert has put together an awesome blog on a powerful, if underrated new feature in Spring 3.1: <a href = "http://hillert.blogspot.com/2011/12/method-validation-with-hibernate.html">support for validating business service methods using JSR 303 and Spring</a>. This support is manifest in the Spring MVC REST support for validating marshalled entities that are part of the request. But, as Gunnar explains, the 
        facility can be used generically in any service tier.   </LI> 

<LI>  Blogger <EM>Mrabti</EM> has the second part of his series
    <a href = "http://crazygui.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/spring-gwt-software-architecture-for-scalable-applications-part-2/">on using Spring and GWT together</a>. Check it out to learn about his architecture and how he used <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/spring-roo">Spring Roo</a> and <a href ="http://www.springsource.org/spring-data">Spring Data</a> together. 

      </LI>
<LI> <EM>Pro Spring</EM> co-author and Spring community member  Jan Machacek  
    has put together a great blog on  <a href= "http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-12-2011/111228-learn-scala-with-specs2spring.html">using the Specs2 Spring testing framework to test your Spring applications</a>. Specs2 is a good way to
              learn Scala, and to test your application.

       </LI>
<LI>  
    Tomasz Nurkiewicz has  put together a post on <a href="http://nurkiewicz.blogspot.com/2011/12/enabling-jmx-in-hibernate-ehcache-qurtz.html">exposing Hibernate's 

 and EhCache's statistics using Spring's JMX exporters</a>. The code's written in Scala, but should translate 
 naturally for those conversant in Java. One little niggle is that he subclasses classes    
    to expose them, which doesn't quite feel right. Sure, it works, but it's probably not required. 

    In the case of the <CODE>javax.sql.DataSource</CODE>, you can simply  reference it when configuring a <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/spring-framework-reference.html#jmx"><CODE>org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter</CODE></a>.   Obtaining the <EM>native</EM> <CODE>EntityManagerFactory</CODE> isn't difficult, either and shouldn't require a subclass, as the <CODE>AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean</CODE> base class exposes a public <CODE>nativeEntityManagerFactory</CODE> field which might have worked instead. Anyway,  the concepts are interesting, and - in the end - the blog <EM>does</EM> demonstrate  how to expose JMX information from objects that don't already expose them, so that's very cool. Nice job!

     </LI>
<LI> JavaCodeGeeks has an interesting post on using Spring to <a href = "http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/12/spring-mvc-and-rest-at-google-app.html">build RESTful services on Google App Engine</a>.  There's very little specific to Spring here (as that just works - after all, Spring's unparalleled in its ability to work on any cloud). Instead, this post covers the minutae of configuring Google App Engine and of configuring Maven, and so on. A worthy read if you're looking for the details.
     </LI>



 <LI> Blogger  John Varghese has an interesting (if slightly not technical) write up 
     of  <A href = "http://softthoughtsbyjohn.blogspot.com/2011/12/enterprise-application-development.html">enterprise application development with Spring Roo</a>. 
       </LI>

<LI>    SpringSource founder and all around great guy Rod Johnson's presentation at QCon, 
       <A href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Things-I-Wish-I-d-Known">Things I'd Wish I'd Known</A>, 
       is also up on InfoQ. Rod is a charming presenter and it's great to hear him talk about the  exhilarating  (if sometimes nerve-wracking) development of  SpringSource.

This support is manifest in the Spring MVC REST support for validating marshalled entities that are part of the request. But, as Gunnar explains, the

    Tomasz Nurkiewicz has  put together a post on <a href="http://nurkiewicz.blogspot.com/2011/12/enabling-jmx-in-hibernate-ehcache-qurtz.html">exposing Hibernate's 

 and EhCache's statistics using Spring's JMX exporters</a>. The code's written in Scala, but should translate 
 naturally for those conversant in Java. One little niggle is that he subclasses classes    
    to expose them, which doesn't quite feel right. Sure, it works, but it's probably not required. 

    In the case of the <CODE>javax.sql.DataSource</CODE>, you can simply  reference it when configuring a <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/spring-framework-reference.html#jmx"><CODE>org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter</CODE></a>.   Obtaining the <EM>native</EM> <CODE>EntityManagerFactory</CODE> isn't difficult, either and shouldn't require a subclass, as the <CODE>AbstractEntityManagerFactoryBean</CODE> base class exposes a public <CODE>nativeEntityManagerFactory</CODE> field which might have worked instead. Anyway,  the concepts are interesting, and - in the end - the blog <EM>does</EM> demonstrate  how to expose JMX information from objects that don't already expose them, so that's very cool. Nice job!

There's very little specific to Spring here (as that just works - after all, Spring's unparalleled in its ability to work on any cloud). Instead, this post covers the minutae of configuring Google App Engine and of configuring Maven, and so on. A worthy read if you're looking for the details.
